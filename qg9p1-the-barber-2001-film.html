                            <p>So far this year, I’ve made a few magic number posts. It started with this one looking at QBs having bad games against unranked opponents (https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b5oq1g/oc_how_concerning_is_it_if_a_qb_has_a_bad_game_in/?st=jtxtj9fuampsh=473fcea0) and how those QBs don’t work out. Then, we took a look at wide receivers who fell below a certain slash line in college (https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b8i76d/oc_why_a_9941_reception_slash_line_is_the_magic/?st=juagp583ampsh=c8. (2018) The House That Jack Built In my mind, this is Lars Von Trier's masterpiece and Matt Dillon's best performance to date. It's hands down the most fun, engaging, darkly humorous, disturbing, bleak and creative film I've seen this year. Runners-up: Annihilation , Apostle , The Bad Seed , Summer of 84 , Mandy , Upgrade , Calibre , Hereditary , A Quiet Place , Bird Box (2017) Mother! Mother! is an incredibly conscientious statement on the nature of humanity, steeped. Let's take a look at the four films from each year going back that made the Makeup/Hairstyling shortlist but didn't end up getting nominated for the Oscar. That gives us a good picture of two more prospective nominees. 2018: Black Panther, Bohemian Rhapsody, Stan amp Ollie, Suspiria 2017: Bright, Ghost in the Shell, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I, Tonya 2016: Deadpool, The Dressmaker, Florence Foster Jenkins, Hail, Caesar! 2015: Black Mass, Concussion, Legend, Mr. Holmes 2014: Looking at the post about Dean's departure from the WWE, I saw a comment there and repeated on twitter about the curse of the 14th entry spot, in which the 14th entrant isn't long for the WWE, and usually on the Road to Wrestlingelsewhere. The Rumble is my favorite event of the year, the only big 4 PPV I've attended, and the only one I never miss, and somehow I had never heard about this particular brand of Rumble Voodoo^kin^mafia. So to rundown my own particular curiosity, I decided 1. The Shining (1980/R/146 m/Stanley Kubrick/759,267) 2. Alien (1979/R/116 m/Ridley Scott/696,127) 3. I Am Legend (2007/PG-13/101 m/Francis Lawrence/622,001) 4. World War Z (2013/PG-13/116 m/Marc Forster/542,585) 5. Psycho (1960/Unrated/109 m/Alfred Hitchcock/522,768) 6. Shaun of the Dead (2004/R/99 m/Edgar Wright/460,651) 7. Zombieland (2009/R/88 m/Ruben Fleischer/448,231) 8. The Conjuring (2013/R/112 m/James Wan/384,956) 9. Get Out (2017/R/104 m/Jordan Peele/361,540) 10. Saw (2004/R/1. 
So i'm going to go on IMDB and look at each MCU movies behind the scenes facts and POST THE MOST INTERESTING ONES here, I will post each movie a day instead of what I did before where I did 10 posts, I will start with the first Iron Man and each day will be the next MCU movie after it, ending with Guardians 3, I will also do the Netflix Shows, Agents of Shield and Agent Carter # THOR: RAGNAROK 1. Thor's "friend from work" line about the Hulk was suggested to Chris Hemsworth by a Make-A.

Lets get the week started off on the right foot by taking a look at RB Brandon Jacobs aka Earth. From his wikipedia, Brandon Christopher Jacobs (born July 6, 1982) is a former American football (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football) running back (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back), who spent the majority of his career with the New York Giants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants) of the National Football League (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Footbal. There’s already so many 31 halloween movie lists, so I wanted to create one with my own expertise and introduce some weird genre films from Asia that people might not have seen that they could add to their own lists for next month. I tried to dig kind of deep and avoid the stuff everyone knows about, like The Grudge, or Pulse, or The Ring, but there's a couple classics in there I guess. If I missed some gems, let me know! So, in no particular order, here’s my list: 1. Wild Zero (1999) It’s the busy season in Tallahassee, so choose your adventures well. HAPPENING THIS WEEK: CAT FEST 2018! “Join us on Sunday, October 21st in Railroad Square for the 3rd annual, FREE charity fundraiser, animal adoption event, and local music festival! All day-of donations and sales go to support Black Cats amp Old Dogs, Feline Advocates of Leon County, and next year's Cat Fest. Adoptable pets will be on location and ready for new homes. Last year, all pets were adopted The Fifty First State is a 2001 film about an American (played by Samuel L Jackson) who comes to England (specifically Liverpool) for a drugs deal. There is much hostility towards Samuel L Jackson from the English underworld, with his aggressive demeanour not going over well. However, one thing I find rather interesting is that although there is a black character amongst the British gangsters (played by Paul Barber aka Denzel from Only Fools and Horses), he is as hostile towards Jackson's. After taking what was meant to be a short break I’m back to making these threads. This time I decided to track down the people who worked on Half-Life 1 and 2. I only looked at Valve for this thread and didn’t include any of the Sierra staff or any of the testers (unless they later joined Valve). Valve lists the names of their staff alphabetically. When I've been able to find it, I've noted what these people did for the games. --- T.K. Backman worked on Half-Life 1, 2 and the episodes.

I figured next we'd do films directed by Tim Burton. He's been making movies for over 30 years, so there's a good number. I don't think it's enough that we'll need a knockout round, though.

After 17 rounds of voting, we have a winner. Outlasting all the other Tim Burton films is one of his first. The winner of the Tim Burton Survivor is. # Beetlejuice (https://letterboxd.com/film/beetlejuice/) Beetlejuice is often considered one of Burton's most fun and original films, so it's probably not a surprise to many that this one won. What is surprising about Beetlejuice is what the film might've looked like had the others in consideration for the it had been cast. Tim Burton. Corpse Bride (https://letterboxd.com/film/corpse-bride/) was eliminated in Round 10. Both feature-length animated films directed by Tim Burton are now out. This elimination also leaves us with only three out of the eight Tim Burton films starring Johnny Depp remaining. Will at least one of those three make it to the final round?

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (https://letterboxd.com/film/sweeney-todd-the-demon-barber-of-fleet-street-2007/) has had its throat slit and is now being used as filling for what are probably the worst pies in London.

It's a battle between two films about pale, creepy, suit-wearing guys who enjoy singing. One man is obsessed with getting his bike back while the other is obsessed murder and revenge. Good, wholesome fun. Which. </p>
