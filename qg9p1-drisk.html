I travel a lot for work. When I'm home, my son and I love to play X-Wing Miniatures together and we have a huge collection, but because of my travel, we don't get to play as much as we want. Are there any good games that a dad and son can play remotely? Something that's turn based so that we can each do our turns when it's convenient and play through the week until I get home? I'm thinking of something that plays the way Words with Friends or Trivia Crack does, but a trivia Welcome to my Channel.

Deadbeat monsters were once normal humans, until one fated accident resulted in their deaths on stage, the entire band and all the support came back as beings made from the very equipment they once worked with.

I am wondering what big is possibility that an attacker can move the important data by some malicious virus from one computer which is offline to another one which can be online. Until I do not plug in to offline hardware everything is surely safe.

So I had a very rough day at work yesterday, came home to my wife and kids, had a nice supper and just relaxed. Around 11:50pm, I jolt awake and I guess I was either mid panic attack or instantly had a major one upon waking.
